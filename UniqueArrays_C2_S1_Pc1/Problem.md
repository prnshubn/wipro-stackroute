## Practice Statement - Unique Arrays

**A company has revamped the health insurance policy for all its insured employees and has increased their health 
cover by 20%. In order to provide them this facility, the HR department needs to collect the data of all 
insured employees and prepare a unique list of their employee ids. 
Write a program to help the HR manager to create a unique list of employee ids to avoid duplication.**

## Example 

    Sample Input :
        int[] salesDepartmentEmpIds = {101,105,106,107,108,109};
    Sample Output:
        true
