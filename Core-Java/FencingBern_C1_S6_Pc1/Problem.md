## Pratice Statement: Fencing a Barn

**Ron wishes to renovate his barn. He thinks that creating fences and keeping the animals separately 
would help him feed the animals easily and prevent the problem of animals getting mixed. 
For this, he plans to divide the area into three parts. He wishes to have a square area for the chickens, 
a circular area for the ducks and a rectangular area for the cows.**
**Write a program in Java to help Ron calculate the area for each fence separately.**
Note: 
- Input 'side' for the square, 'length and breadth' for rectangle and 'radius' for circle.   
- Modularize your code by writing separate functions to calculate the area of each of the fence shapes.

**Sample Input:**

    Select an option from list to calculate area of fence
    1. Square area for the chickens
    2. Circular area for ducks
    3. Rectangular area for cows

    1
    Enter side of square : 12

**Sample Output:**

    Area of square fence for chickens is 144.0
