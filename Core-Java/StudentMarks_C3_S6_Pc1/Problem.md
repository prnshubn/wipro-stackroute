## Practice Statement: Score of Students

**The total marks of all the students of grade 12, irrespective of the stream opted by them has to be calculated. The subjects vary depending on their choice of stream.**

**For example**

- A student who has opted for the medical stream will get marks for math, physics, chemistry and biology
- A student who has opted for the non medical stream will get marks for math, physics and chemistry 
- A student who has chosen the commerce stream will get marks for business studies, finance and accounts


**Write a program with overloaded methods that will help calculate marks of the different streams of Grade 12 students.**
