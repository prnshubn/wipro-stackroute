## Practice Statement: Calorie Tracker

**Anne is using a calorie tracker app that helps her keep a record of all her physical activities and her daily intake of calories**
**The calories burned by her doing some of the common physical activities are:**

	1. 30 minutes of cycling burns around 300 calories
	2. 30 minutes of swimming burns around 200 calories
	3. 30 minutes of running burns around 500 calories

**Anne can lose one pound of weight for each 1000 calories burned. Her daily extra calorie intake tracked by the app is 100**
**Write a java program to calculate the number of pounds Anne can lose in a month if she does each of the above 
mentioned activities once a week for 1 hour and chooses to do one activity per day.**


**Sample Input:**

    Calorie burnt by cycling : 200
    Calorie burnt by running : 200
    Calorie burnt by swimming: 200
    Calorie intake in a day  : 100

**Sample Output:**

    Weight lost by Anne in a month is : 5.0 pounds
