## Practice Statement : Bus Route
**Florida Red Line LLC runs a local bus service in the city of Florida, USA. An analysis done to check the total percentage of the commuters revealed that 40% of the city’s population uses the local bus service to commute daily. In order to decide which routes require more frequency of buses and to estimate the number of tickets sold and the total collections made on these routes, the Florida Red Line LLC needs to do an analysis of the ticketing data.**

**In this challenge, perform the following activities:**

1. Read ticketing data from sample.csv file and store the data in a list
2. Sort the data as per the distance travelled by a bus in descending order.
3. Calculate the total collections made from the sale of these tickets.
