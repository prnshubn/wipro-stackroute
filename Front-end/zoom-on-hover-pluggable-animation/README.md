## Zoom On Hover Pluggable Animation - Practice Challenge

### Overview 

ZL Tech is a Miami-based IT solutions provider. They excel in providing IT solutions in various domains ranging from banking, insurance to e-commerce. After a survey, ZL Tech learned that the demand for pluggable animations is high. Hence, the software development team has decided to create pluggable animations which can be reused and plugged onto any element that needs to be animated. 

### Why Pluggable Animations? 

Organizations always want the UI of their apps to be enhanced with pleasing aesthetics. One of the ways to improve aesthetics is to use animation effects. However, recreating animations for multiple elements of an app is a time-consuming affair. Moreover, it lacks reusability and will not be applicable in different apps.  

### Challenge 

One such animation is to zoom the element when hovered upon. As a junior developer, you have been assigned to create this Hover on Zoom pluggable animation. 

With Angular, this can be made possible through a custom attribute directive. 

### Instructions 

Following are the key features of this animation: 

- The element should zoom when hovered upon; otherwise, zoom out 

- Also, the zoomed element should always be in front and not overlapped by adjacent elements 

- Ensure the zoom in to zoom out, and vice versa has a smooth transition effect 

- Additionally, provide an option to allow the user to disable the zoom effect 

- This directive can be created and tested for its correctness on the Imagegram app, where it can be applied to the page title and the images resulting in a similar effect. 

**Note: The Imagegram app is the same app developed in Task 3 of the Mastery challenge in Sprint - Develop SPA Using Angular Components.**
