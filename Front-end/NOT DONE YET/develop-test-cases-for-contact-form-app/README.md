#### Context

Prime Solutions is an IT solutions provider company who has earned reputation in providing IT solutions in different business domains.​​​

Recently they have been approached to develop OneStopSolutions web application.​​​

Through this application the consumers can reach out to various services.​​​

One of the key component of the app is to build a contact book for all the service providers.​​​

Prime Solutions have approached Graffitti designers for a good UI design for managing contacts..​​​

The design is ready and now is functional.​​

##### Contact Form

The details are fetched and displayed in alphabetical order of name

#### Challenge

The organization now wants to ensure the behavior of the contact form is meeting the expectations​

As a developer you need to develop test code and test the code using Jasmine framework

#### Problem Statement

#### Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.  
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Provide the solution code inside the respective `.js` file for each problem.
