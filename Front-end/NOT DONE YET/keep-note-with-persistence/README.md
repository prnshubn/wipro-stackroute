# KeepNote

### Implementing Persistence with KeepNote App

### KeepNote App - Phase 2

KeepNote App is a text-based note-keeping app that can be synced with other apps (such as calendar) for work efficiency. 

It has a masonry layout where the individual grid modifies its height per the input by the user. 

It has a simple and user-friendly design and layout.

The design is ready and the app displays the notes in masonry layout container

### Challenge

Currently, the added notes are not getting persisted.

The newly added notes get automatically deleted when the app refreshes

### Problem Statement

In Phase 2 of KeepNote development, you as a junior developer is required to implement persistence with Note data

The notes should be persisted in .json file through json-server

**Note: The KeepNote app is the same app developed in Task 2 of the Mastery challenge in Sprint - Develop SPA Using Angular Components**
