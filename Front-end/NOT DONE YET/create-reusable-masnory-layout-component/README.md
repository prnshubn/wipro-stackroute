# Create Reusable Masnory Layout Component 

### Texas Technologies Limited is a US multinational corporation that provides information technology, consulting, and business process services. It is headquartered in Austin, Texas. 

The company is providing software solutions to variety of clients and their projects.

For the different frontend applications for different clients, it has been observed that, similar UI elements are required across.

Presently, since the component design code resides within the application, the components are not re-usable

Rewriting the code for components is costly and time-consuming as it not only has to be re-developed but also has to be tested everytime it is used.

Hence, the management has decided to create a library of Web components using Angular that could be published to NPM Registry (Npmjs.com) and be re-used for the company's future projects as and when required.
